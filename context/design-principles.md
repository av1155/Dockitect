# Dockitect Design Principles

## Purpose

Define core design principles for **Dockitect** to ensure a consistent, accessible experience for **homelab administrators and self-hosters** across **web browsers (desktop and tablet)**.

## Core Principles

- **Accessibility First:** Design for all abilities; meet or exceed **WCAG 2.2 AA** standards
- **Clarity & Hierarchy:** Emphasize clear content and visual hierarchy; technical users value precision over decoration
- **Consistency:** Use consistent patterns, terminology, and layouts across all views
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Reveal complexity gradually to avoid overwhelming users; start simple, show details on demand
- **Meaningful Feedback & States:** Provide timely, clear feedback; use distinct states (loading, success, error, warning)
- **Error Prevention & Recovery:** Prevent errors when possible (validation, warnings); ensure easy recovery with actionable messages
- **Performance & Perceived Speed:** Optimize for fast performance; provide feedback during delays (import/export operations)
- **Responsive/Adaptive Design:** Work well on desktop and tablet (min-width 768px); optimized for canvas interaction
- **Internationalization & RTL:** Support multiple languages and right-to-left layouts (future consideration)
- **Privacy & Data Minimization:** Minimize data collection; respect user privacy; no telemetry by default
- **Ethical & Inclusive Design:** Design for diverse users and scenarios; avoid bias and exclusion
- **Resilience/Offline Tolerance:** Gracefully handle network issues; support offline use when possible (local-first)

## Decision Rules

Follow this priority order:

1. **User Goals** – prioritize the needs of **homelab administrators** (clarity, speed, reliability)
2. **Accessibility** – ensure inclusive access
3. **Clarity** – make it easy to understand (technical precision > marketing speak)
4. **Efficiency** – enable quick use (minimize clicks, support keyboard shortcuts)
5. **Brand Expression** – reflect the brand appropriately (professional, trustworthy)
6. **Aesthetics** – enhance visual appeal (clean, minimal, functional)

If unresolved: 1) state each option's goal or principle; 2) choose the higher-priority option; 3) document trade-offs
