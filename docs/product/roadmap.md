# Dockitect Product Roadmap

> **This document is authoritative for Dockitect's execution plan. Update it as phases complete.**

---

## Overview

This roadmap takes Dockitect from zero to GA (General Availability) through seven phased milestones. Each phase delivers a demoable, independently mergeable artifact with visual evidence (GIF/screenshot). The strategy follows trunk-based development with small, vertical-slice PRs, Conventional Commits, and semantic versioning.

**Planning Principles:**

- Week-sized phases, day-sized tasks
- Three core slices first: Importer v0 â†’ Exporter v0 â†’ Conflict Lint v0
- Every phase ends with a working demo
- Deterministic YAML export non-negotiable
- No docker.sock access; file-based only

---

## P0: Repository & Project Setup

**Goal:** Bootstrap a production-ready monorepo with CI/CD, linting, testing infrastructure, and foundational architecture docs.

## P2: MVP Exporter (Blueprint â†’ Compose v2.x)

**Goal:** Export canvas blueprint to deterministic, stable docker-compose.yml files.

**Scope:**

- `/packages/exporter`: Blueprint â†’ Compose YAML generator
- Deterministic key ordering (services, networks, volumes alphabetically)
- Stable env/port/volume ordering within each service (use fast-json-stable-stringify for objects)
- Download button in UI triggers export
- Round-trip test: import â†’ modify â†’ export â†’ re-import â†’ compare
- E2E test: draw 2 services â†’ export â†’ verify valid compose

**Deliverables:**

- "Export Compose" button downloads `docker-compose.yml`
- Exported YAML is valid Compose v2.x (docker compose config validates)
- Keys sorted alphabetically; arrays maintain insertion order
- Round-trip tests pass (importâ†’exportâ†’import produces identical Blueprint)
- Animated GIF: "Draw Topology â†’ Export Compose"
- CLI test script: `docker compose -f exported.yml config --quiet` succeeds

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Exporter produces valid Compose v2.x (validated by `docker compose config`)
- [ ] Exported YAML has stable key order (multiple exports produce identical diffs)
- [ ] Round-trip test: fixture.yml â†’ Blueprint â†’ export.yml (semantically equivalent)
- [ ] E2E test creates 2 services on canvas, exports, downloads file
- [ ] Code coverage â‰¥80% for exporter package
- [ ] No external dependencies on Docker daemon (file-based only)

**Risks & Rollback:**

- Risk: Docker Compose spec deviations â†’ Mitigation: Test against official docker/compose-spec examples
- Risk: Non-deterministic output â†’ Mitigation: Snapshot tests for YAML output; use stable stringify
- Rollback: Disable export button; keep import-only functionality

**Dependencies:**

- Tech: `yaml` package with custom ordering, `fast-json-stable-stringify`
- Sequencing: Requires P1 (Blueprint schema & importer)

**Estimated Effort:** **L** (5-7 days)

---

## P3: Conflict Lint & Validation

**Goal:** Detect and highlight port collisions, volume conflicts, missing env vars, and duplicate service names.

**Scope:**

- Validation engine in `/packages/schema` (Zod refinements + custom linters)
- Lint rules v0:
    - Duplicate host ports on same host/network â†’ error
    - Duplicate service names â†’ error
    - Volume target conflicts (RW vs RO) â†’ warning
    - Missing env variables referenced in commands â†’ warning
- UI: Conflict panel showing errors/warnings with node highlighting
- Auto-fix suggestions (e.g., increment port, rename service)
- Unit tests for each lint rule with positive/negative cases

**Deliverables:**

- Conflict panel component in `/apps/web/components/ConflictPanel.tsx`
- Visual indicators on canvas (red badge for errors, yellow for warnings)
- "Auto-fix" button for simple conflicts (port increment, service rename)
- E2E test: import conflicting compose â†’ verify error panel shown â†’ apply fix â†’ verify error cleared
- Animated GIF: "Detect Port Conflict â†’ Auto-Fix"

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] 4 lint rules implemented with test coverage â‰¥90%
- [ ] Conflict panel lists all errors/warnings with source node references

- [ ] Auto-fix resolves â‰¥2 conflict types (port, name)
- [ ] E2E test: upload conflicting-ports.yml â†’ see 2 errors â†’ click fix â†’ export valid compose
- [ ] Validation runs on every canvas change (debounced 500ms)

**Risks & Rollback:**

- Risk: False positives in lint rules â†’ Mitigation: Make rules configurable; start with conservative checks
- Risk: Performance degradation on large graphs â†’ Mitigation: Debounce validation; run in web worker if needed
- Rollback: Disable conflict panel; keep validation logic for API use

**Dependencies:**

- Tech: Zod refinements, graph traversal utilities
- Sequencing: Requires P1 (Blueprint), P2 (Export for validation)

**Estimated Effort:** **M** (4-6 days)

- Privacy: no telemetry by default; opt-in flag documented

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Prisma schema includes `Project` (id, name, createdAt, updatedAt) and `Blueprint` (projectId, version, data JSON)
- [ ] Save blueprint API persists to SQLite; load API retrieves latest version
- [ ] Projects list shows â‰¥1 project after creation
- [ ] Auto-save triggers 2s after last canvas change (debounced)
- [ ] Settings persist in localStorage (theme, export prefs)
- [ ] E2E test: save â†’ close browser â†’ reopen â†’ blueprint restored
- [ ] Migration script documented in `/docs/adr/0002-persistence.md`

**Risks & Rollback:**

- Risk: SQLite corruption or locking â†’ Mitigation: Use WAL mode; test concurrent writes
- Risk: Data loss on crash â†’ Mitigation: Auto-save frequently; add "recover last session" feature
- Rollback: Disable persistence; use localStorage for single-session state

**Dependencies:**

- Tech: Prisma, SQLite, Next.js API routes or server actions
- Sequencing: Requires P1 (Blueprint schema), P4 (templates for testing)

**Estimated Effort:** **M** (4-5 days)
